# Assignment4: File Handling in C++ Part2
 
## Overview
This assignment delves into C++ file handling for reading and processing triangle data from a file. The implementation is divided between two files: Reader.cpp and Writer.cpp. The tasks include utilizing the getline() function, employing istringstream for string parsing, creating Point3D objects, populating a vector of Triangle objects, and extracting only the vertex values from the .stl file.
## Implementation Steps
 
1. **Implemented the getline() function within getTriangles() at the location Exercise4\src\Reader.cpp.**.
2. **Implemented if condition logic to selectively read only vertex values from the .stl file at the location Exercise4\src\Reader.cpp.**
3. **Utilized an istringstream to parse the string at the location Exercise4\src\Reader.cpp.**.
4. **Extracted all values and passed each (x, y, z) value to the Point3D class object at the location Exercise4s\src\Reader.cpp.**.
5. **Added that object to the vector of Triangle class type at the location Exercise4\src\Reader.cpp.**.
6. **Employed a range-for loop to print out the data from each object in the write() function at the location Exercise4\src\Writer.cpp.**.
