# Assignment 13 - Implementation of Interfacing of C++ functions with C code.
## Overview

This assignment entails the utilization of C code to implement a specific part of the program. This approach is applicable to most programming languages, with only variations in keywords or methods. The objective is to enhance program efficiency by treating a segment of code directly as a C program.

## Function Declaration and Definition

1. **Function File:**
   - The function declaration is housed in /src/printLib.h, which contains the portion of the code to be implemented as a C function but referenced through a C++ file.
   - A macro #ifdef __cplusplus is implemented to recognize the file into which it is being included. If included in a C++ file, it runs extern "C" {}.
   - In `/src/printLib.cpp` file we are implementing the `void printMsg()` function.
   ```
   void printMsg()
   {
    printf("Error! File Not Found!\n");
   }
    ``` 
   - Function `printMsg()` print error message.

2. **Usage:**
   - In the file /src/Reader.cpp, the above file is included. The function void Reader::getTriangles(std::vector<Triangle>& triangles) utilizes the void printMsg() function.
   - When the reader encounters difficulty reading the file, it calls the function to print an error on the console.
   - The use of the extern "C" keyword instructs the C++ compiler not to perform name mangling while writing symbols in the ObjectDump file.
