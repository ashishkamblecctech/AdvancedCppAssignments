# Assignment3: File Handling in C++ Part1
 
## Overview
This assignment revolves around C++ file handling for reading and processing triangle data from a file. The implementation is divided between two files: Reader.cpp. The tasks include the utilization of the getline() function, employing istringstream for string parsing, creating Point3D objects, populating a vector of Triangle objects, and extracting only the vertex values from the .stl file.

## Implementation Steps
 
1. **Implemented the getline() function within getTriangles() at the location Ex3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp.**.
2. **Utilized an istringstream to parse the string at the location Ex3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp.**.
3. **Extracted all values and passed each (x, y, z) value to the Point3D class object at the location Ex3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp.**.
4. **Added that object to the vector of Triangle class type at the location Ex3\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp.**.
